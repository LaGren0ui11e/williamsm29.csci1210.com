		<h2>Paris, Tennessee</h2> <!-- put your hometown here -->
		<p>
			I grew up in Paris, Tennessee. Paris is a small town with a population of just over 10,000 people. It was incorporated in 1823. Paris is best know for "The World's Biggest Fish Fry" where on the last full week of April the whole town shuts down for a big parade. The morning after the parade there are catfish races held on right outside the courthouse in the middle of Paris.

		<h2>My Education</h2> <!-- don't change this -->
		<p>
			My name is Matt Williams. I am a Computer Science major in my first year of working on a Computer Science degree. I expect to graduate in May of 2025, but I will be trying to finish earlier if possible. I am most interested in understanding how the programs that run our lives work and how to create useful programs.
